It's no secret security teams get a lot of things wrong. Especially yours right? Having worked in the security industry for the past six years I have absolutely noticed some of these, _"shortcomings"_ to put it gently. While many may feel that security is simply a legal or compliance issue, I believe it is this exact logic that ultimately leads orgs to see security as "blockers" and proliferate this negative sentiment around security and what they do (or don't do).

## background

The hiring of a security team is a purposeful act which from my experience transpires from one of two scenarios. Reactive or proactive.

### Reactive

A reactive hire could indicate a response to an audit, incident, compliance mandate, or certification.

### Proactive

Proactive hires are used to hopefully address any large gaps in your security posture/program before it's too late.

There is a secret third option that exists which I'll get into later. Nevertheless these two options describe nearly every case I have come across during my time working in security. These also track with conversations I've had with others who have decades of experience. You either make your first security hire before you need to, or after you need to.

This brings us to [the tweet](https://x.com/thdxr/status/1821219997571518666). To be fair, I enjoy a lot of content that [@thdxr](https://x.com/thdxr) creates, however an `L` may be warranted in this case. The tweet is an observation of his experience with internal security and compliance teams at large organizations. The language clearly indicates he believes security/compliance teams do unmeaningful work by adding undue processes just for the sake of looking like they are _doing_ security.

I couldn't disagree more. Listen, I believe there is some amount of truth in everything. Even the things you seemingly couldn't disagree more with. The truth is, security and compliance is broken at a lot of large organizations, but not because security is arbitrarily adding processes without any care to the side effects.

This one, single [response](https://x.com/elithrar/status/1821238347387564074) clearly stands out from [@elithrar](https://x.com/elithrar). This is a beautiful response as it brings me to the entire point of this post. Security exists as a function of your current processes.

## Mind the gaps

Whether your security team was hired reactively or proactively they ultimately inherit whatever processes your organization had in place beforehand. If your organization is of the scale of Apple, Meta, Amazon, or Google then you more than likely had very fine grained processes in place with a very specific requirements for where security fits into the bigger picture. Years of past audits, certifications, and breaches or incidents dictate precisely and for good reason what your policies look like and how effective they are.

However, if you're like most other oganizations then you haven't had the priviliedge of being able to fester on decades of poor processes until someone finally caved and decided to take ownership of the clean up. This is precisely what many people fail to understand. It takes someone with a lot incentive to get out the broom and mop and start cleaning up. If you ever find yourself in the uncomfortable position of being the subject of an audit, trying for your first certification, or doing a RCA after a security incident; your processes, or lacktherof, will be what decides your ability to come out the other side.

<!-- Security like any other technology based career comes with its own very unique set of complexities. If you work in technology (especially engineering) this is to be expected. Sprawling technical debt, ambitious sales teams, and whatever the hell some stakeholder thinks up in the shower that morning lead to bad decisions being made all of the time. An engineers job is to find out (and _eventually_ implement) a real world solution based on these decisions without making unreasonable trade offs. -->
<!-- This clearly puts the engineer in a very critical position. They must measure the outcomes of every possible decision and whether or not their own interpreation, understanding, and ultimately execution of the solution (a solution they are authoring), is viable. While mature orgs (i.e. Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix) will point to decades of processes clearly defining and spreading the decision making process across multiple people and teams, most companies are not near this level of maturity. -->
